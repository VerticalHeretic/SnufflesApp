# SnufflesApp

App showing off usage of Rick And Morty API

## What could be improved: 
- [ ] MacOS target should be improved for working with side bar and details view
- [ ] Add some Unit tests for logic
- [ ] Work on to exclude the coreData logic from the view (for convinience it was put there, but probably should be done in viewModel or even some additionall service)
